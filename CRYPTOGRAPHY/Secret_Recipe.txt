Parisian Secret Croissants

Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 cup cold unsalted butter, sliced thinly
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

Instructions:
1. Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.

2. Prepare the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and milk. Mix until a dough forms.

3. Incorporate the Butter: Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a rectangle. Place the thinly sliced cold butter evenly over two-thirds of the dough. Fold the unbuttered third over the buttered middle third, then fold the other buttered third over the top. This creates three layers.

4. Chill the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

5. Roll and Fold: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out into a rectangle again. Fold it into thirds, as before. Chill for another 30 minutes.

6. Repeat Rolling and Folding: Repeat the rolling and folding process two more times, chilling the dough for 30 minutes between each step. This creates the flaky layers characteristic of croissants.

7. Shape the Croissants: Roll out the dough into a large rectangle and cut it into triangles. Roll each triangle starting from the wide end towards the tip to form the classic croissant shape.

8. Proofing: Place the shaped croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover them loosely with a kitchen towel and let them proof in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

9. Preheat and Bake: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the croissants with beaten egg for a shiny finish. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
